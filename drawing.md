# Drawing Dakimakuras

Dakimakura covers are typically 160cm by 50cm at around 200 dpi. The size can vary, with 150cm by 50cm being another common size. Since covers are two sided, it is common for a dakimakura design to have both a front and back side of the same character in different poses, or with some other variation (different outfit, NSFW version, etc).

## Quick Tips

* It's best to decide on a printer before drawing the design.
  * Each printer may have different recommendations for canvas size, color space, etc.
  * RGB color space and 200dpi (at 160cm by 50cm) is a safe bet.
* The character should be completely within the canvas (no limbs out of frame).
  * Its OK if long hair, large clothing (like dresses), and the like go out of frame.
  * This only applies to the character. Clutter can be partially out of frame.
* Prefer placing the character near the top of the canvas rather than the middle.
  * People sleep with their head near the top of a body pillow, so that's where the character should be.
  * This is not an issue for most designs where characters take up most vertical space.
  * It's ok if smaller characters and certain poses leave a lot of space under their feet.
* Allow for a 1-2% margin that will be cut off when the cover is sown together.

## Character(s)

A majority of dakimakura designs have only one character on both sides of the cover. While there is nothing stopping you from drawing a design with different characters on either side, or multiple characters on one side, these designs are much more niche and may not sell as well as a single character design. Obviously this is not an issue if you are being commissioned to draw a design for one person.

## Poses

Regardless of the pose, almost all designs have the character looking towards the viewer. Multi-character designs may have the characters looking at each other. Poses are most often drawn from a top-down perspective, but characters on their side could be drawn from a side perspective (where the bed is only visible on the bottom half of the canvas). It may be useful to reference other designs for pose ideas (check out [fosblog - nsfw](http://fosblog.blog94.fc2.com/)), but tracing a pose from an existing design is highly frowned upon - especially if the design will be sold.

To save time (and possibly money for your commissioner), the front and back of a cover may use the same pose with some other variation (different outfit, less clothing, or other variations).

## Background

Most dakimakura covers feature a bed-like design with white sheets, no pillow, and minimal clutter. Adding a more sophisticated background to a design can add a lot of personality to the artwork, but may also be a turn off for those who sleep with them.

## Ecchi / NSFW

Generally speaking, NSFW designs are more popular than SFW designs, however some customers will not be comfortable buying NSFW or even Ecchi designs. Be mindful of this when drawing the cover, and if working with a commissioner, be sure to clarify their comfort level with "lewd" content.

## Censorship

Be mindful of your country's laws regarding censorship of obscene content, especially when it comes to young looking characters (loli/shota). Designs from Japan are often censored due to Japanese obscenity laws which leads to "barbie doll" censorship, a lack of detail in the genitals, or mosaic blurring. In most other countries this is not an issue.
