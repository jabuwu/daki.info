# Buying Japanese Covers

A majority of dakimakura covers are sold in Japan in limited quantities making it very difficult to obtain for those outside of Japan. Covers sold online may not ship internationally while other covers are only sold physically at events within Japan.

## Finding New Covers

The best way to keep up with new releases is to use [OMIAI Dakimakura](http://omiai-dakimakura.com/) (NSFW), a website dedicated to showcasing new Dakimakura covers, as well as reprints. A prerequisite for all covers posted on this website is that the cover must be purchasable from within Japan, including covers from online retail sites and designs available at events within Japan (like Comiket). A few covers listed on OMIAI can be purchased world-wide, but it is not guaranteed.

## Buying Covers Online

If a website does not ship internationally you might still be able to buy it using a Proxy or Forwarding service. (TODO: link to proxy/forwarding info)
